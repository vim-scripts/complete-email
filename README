Allow completion of email addresses so you can use Vim as a basic "address book".

This is useful when you use Vim to compose emails in a program such as mutt. I have the following settings in my muttrc:

	set edit_headers = yes          # Edit the headers of your outgoing messages
	set autoedit = yes              # Go directly to editor after pressing m

After pressing m I immediately go to Vim, and can fill out the headers myself:

	From: Martin Tournoij <martin@arp242.net>
	To: 
	Cc: 
	Bcc: 
	Subject: 
	Reply-To: 

I can then use this plugin to quickly fill in the To:, Cc:, etc. fields.


Basic usage
-----------------------
- Use <C-x><C-m> to complete.
- Use :AddEmailAddress to add a new email address.
- Email addresses are stored in ~/.mutt/address by default. You can configure this by setting g:complete_email_file.


File format
---------------------
There are 3 fields in the address file. name, email address, and extra info. The extra info is shown preview window. These fields are separated by the 0x1e character. Type <C-v>x1e to insert it.


Other scripts
